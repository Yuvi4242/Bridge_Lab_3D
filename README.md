☕ Bridge_Lab_3D — Java Learning Journal

📘 A documentation of my Java learning journey (Sessions 1–7)
Guided through hands-on sessions and practical coding exercises.

🧩 Session 1 – Kicking Off with Git

Learned the difference between Git (tool) & GitHub (platform)

Explored repositories, branches, and merges

Practiced the commit → push → pull workflow

Understood version history & meaningful commit messages

💡 Takeaway: I can now manage and version-control my code confidently — no more losing progress!

⚙️ Session 2 – Inside the Java Machine

Explored JVM Architecture (Class Loader, Memory, Execution Engine)

Differentiated between compiler and interpreter

Learned how Garbage Collection automates memory management

💡 Takeaway: I now understand what happens “behind the scenes” when Java code runs.

🧱 Session 3 – Back to the Basics

Practiced variables, literals, and data types

Worked with input/output (I/O) operations

Used operators and the var keyword for type inference

Clarified scope and lifetime of variables

💡 Takeaway: Built a solid foundation for writing efficient Java programs.

🔁 Session 4 – Logic & Flow

Learned sequence, selection (if, else, switch), and iteration (for, while, do-while)

Practiced for-each loops for collections and arrays

Used transfer statements – break, continue, return

Built a basic calculator app

💡 Takeaway: My code can now think and repeat — just like a real problem solver!

🧮 Session 5 – Diving into Arrays

Worked with 1D, 2D, and multi-dimensional arrays

Explored the java.util.Arrays utility class

Used System.arraycopy() for array duplication

💡 Takeaway: Arrays help organize and manage large sets of data efficiently.

🔤 Session 6 – Strings & Methods Galore
🧵 Strings

Explored String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer, and StringTokenizer

Used common methods: length(), charAt(), substring(), etc.

Passed strings as parameters and reviewed ASCII codes

⚡ Methods

Defined user-defined methods for modular code

Differentiated static vs instance methods

Utilized Math class methods like Math.random()

💡 Takeaway: Combining strings and methods makes code modular, reusable, and dynamic.

🧠 Session 7 – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Understood the 4 Pillars of OOP:

🧩 Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods in one class

🧱 Abstraction: Hiding implementation details

🔗 Inheritance: Reusing parent class features

🎭 Polymorphism: Same method, different behavior (overloading/overriding)

Created classes and objects

Implemented constructors (default & parameterized)

Explored this and super keywords

Practiced method overloading & overriding

Got introduced to interfaces and abstract classes

💡 Takeaway: OOP allows building real-world, modular, and scalable software systems.
