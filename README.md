Java Learning Journal (Sessions 1–7)

---

### Session 1 – Kicking Off with Git
- Figured out the difference between Git (tool) & GitHub (platform)  
- Learned about repos, branches, and merges  
- Practiced commit → push → pull workflow  
- Explored version history & commit messages  

**Takeaway:** I can now manage my code versions without fear of losing progress.  

---

### Session 2 – Inside the Java Machine
- Understood JVM architecture  
- Learned what compiler vs interpreter actually do  
- Discovered how garbage collection keeps memory clean  

**Takeaway:** I finally see what’s happening when my Java code really runs.  

---

### Session 3 – Back to the Basics
- Worked with variables, literals & data types  
- Practiced basic I/O  
- Explored operators  
- Tried `var` keyword for type inference  
- Got clarity on scope of variables  

**Takeaway:** Stronger grip on the building blocks of coding.  

---

### Session 4 – Logic & Flow
- Learned sequence, selection (`if/else`, `switch`), iteration (loops)  
- Used for-each loop  
- Practiced transfer statements (`break`, `continue`, `return`)  
- Built a basic calculator app  

**Takeaway:** My programs can now “decide” and “repeat” like real problem solvers.  

---

### Session 5 – Diving into Arrays
- Practiced 1D, 2D, and multi-dimensional arrays  
- Used `java.util.Arrays` class utilities  
- Tried array copying with `System.arraycopy()`  

**Takeaway:** Arrays = structured ways to hold multiple values neatly.  

---

### Session 6 – Strings & Methods Galore
**Strings:**  
- Used `String`, `StringBuilder`, `StringBuffer`, `StringTokenizer`  
- Practiced string methods (`length()`, `charAt()`, `substring()`, etc.)  
- Passed strings as parameters  
- Reviewed ASCII character codes  

**Methods:**  
- Wrote own methods (user-defined)  
- Explored static & library methods  
- Played with `Math` class methods (`Math.random()`)  

**Takeaway:** Strings + methods made my code more reusable, dynamic, and powerful.  

---

### Session 7 – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Understood the 4 pillars of OOP:
  - **Encapsulation** → bundling data & methods inside classes  
  - **Abstraction** → hiding implementation details, focusing on behavior  
  - **Inheritance** → reusing parent class properties in child classes  
  - **Polymorphism** → same method behaving differently (overloading/overriding)  
- Practiced creating classes & objects  
- Learned about constructors (default, parameterized)  
- Explored `this` & `super` keywords  
- Implemented method overloading & overriding  
- Got an intro to `interfaces` and `abstract classes`  

**Takeaway:** OOP helps me structure code like real-world entities—more modular, reusable, and scalable.

### Overall Progress (Sessions 1–7)
✔ Version control with Git  
✔ Understood Java internals (JVM & Garbage Collector)  
✔ Covered basics → loops → arrays → strings → methods  
✔ Stepped into Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, OOP pillars)  

**Next:** Exception Handling & Collections 🚀
